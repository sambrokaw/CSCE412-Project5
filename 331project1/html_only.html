        <h1>Sam Brokaw</h1>
        <p> Howdy, my name is Sam Brokaw and I am a junior Computer Science major at Texas A&M University</p>
        <p> I am a problem solver at heart and would love to use that passion for the benefit of a team. I also like playing 
            Jeopardy, spikeball, disc golf, and ultimate frisbee with my friends. 
        </p>
        <p> I participated in two very different but equally insigtful work experiences this summer that taught me how to work better with people
            and communicate my ideas and visions effectively. (Qualifications Link here)
